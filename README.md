## About
This is my personal blog to share my interested technical reviews specially on the domain of server backbone algorithm and machine learnings.

I am a full-stack developer and dedicated in algorithms, I am passionate to share:

## Useful Self-Study Small Projects

I knew the solution and was using it effectively, but it took me years to see it for what it was.

As a professional software developer, it was part of my job to stay on top of tools, techniques, APIs and programming languages.

Like many developers, I do this by designing and executing small projects on the side that use a tool or technique in order for me to learn it through applying it.

I was using this methodology to teach myself machine learning on the side. I even used this strategy to get me through two higher degrees, that I now realize I didnâ€™t need to get.

Yes, you can be highly effective and deliver tons of value in business with the tools of applied machine learning, without getting a Ph.D.!

## Learn from my Missteps

It was difficult when my interest in machine learning was kindled in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

There were a few sites out there, but nothing that I felt spoke to me as first an interested programmer and later, a professional programmer.


Machine learning is described in academic language from books, papers, and even websites. I felt (I now believe wrongly) that I had to get higher degrees to figure this stuff out. I quit my job and went back to school to earn a Masters and Ph.D. degrees.

I completed my research work leveraging the skills I already had as a professional developer: designing and executing small projects in order to learn and master skills.

## Applications

I have come full circle and happily became a professional developer again.

I started working with severe weather meteorologists to solve complex problems for real users that are interested and excited about the solutions.

I can confidently wield machine learning algorithms to solve problems at work, for clients, and even for myself when participating in competitions or creating my own software.

I now spend my days working with developers to get started and really kick ass with applied machine learning.
